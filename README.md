What is the spatiotemporal power spectrum of the visual signal for a modern human as they go about normal daily tasks? How does this change as tasks differ, and how do different types of motion such as environmental, body, head, and eye motion contribute to the signal that lands on the retina?

We analyze data recorded from a custom designed and built head mounted eye tracker, an update of the BORIS project, utilizing high frame rate Ximea cameras, Pupil Labs eye tracking, and Intel Realsense Cameras & Trackers to record subjects during natural tasks. We calculate the spatiotemporal power spectrum of the recorded video with and without eye motion overlaid to answer the questions posed above.
